### Magitnups battleship is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal of Heroku. Users will battle against it out against their own PC and for once maybe actually win to vent some frustrations.<br>

### How to play

---

Battleships in general is a classic and very simple pen and paper game.
This version allows the users to decide where they want to hide their fleet of 6 ships on a 10 times 10 playing field. The Computer will naturally hide its own ships as well.

After hiding the ships, the player will be allowed to shoot first in every round. Which gives the player the advantage in the case of a draw.

Whenever a ship gets hit, it'll will be marked by an "o", the last hit sinking the ship and marking it with "s". In case of a missed shot it will mark the area with "x".
