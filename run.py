#Plan:
# 2 boards: one engine board and one player board
# engine board randomly selects places for ships
# player board allows for players choice to place ships
# validation for locking in the "goods" on the ships
# no repeat guesses, no out of bounds guesses
# smart guesses on the  side after a ship is found
# boards are 10x10 -> input 33 = row 3 column 3 starting with 0 - 9 for each
